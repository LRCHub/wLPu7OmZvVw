[00:03.03] Only you can make my dreams come true
[00:15.29] Only you can turn my skies to blue
[00:26.95] Love like ours should not be far apart
[00:45.95] 
[00:38.67] Only you can break my heart
[00:52.17] 
[01:13.92] Only you can end these sleepless nights
[01:25.48] Only you can make things turn out right
[01:37.37] You and you alone can keep us far apart
[01:56.87] 
[01:49.20] Only you can break my heart
[02:00.92] Only you can break my heart
