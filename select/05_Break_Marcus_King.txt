I don't know, darlin', who's name you're callin'
But don't you mistake him for me
You're fallin' apart, but don't let your heart
Break for nobody but me

Got us all guessing who you'll be blessing
Everyone's waiting to see
You think you're so smart, but don't let your heart
Break for nobody but me

Funny how this town will forget you
Sooner or later you'll see
I'll always be there to catch you
If somebody's shaking your tree
Don't let your heart
Break for nobody but me

Funny how this town will forget you
Sooner or later you'll see
I'll always be there to catch you
If somebody's shaking your tree
Where are you going at four in the mornin'?
You think that I'm fast asleep
Alone in the dark, but don't let your heart
Break for nobody but me

Alone in the dark, but don't let your heart
Break for nobody
Ache for nobody
Break for nobody but me
