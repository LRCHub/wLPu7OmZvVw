Don't break the heart that loves you handle it with care
Don't break the heart that needs you darling please be fair
Why do you flirt and constantly hurt me
Why do you treat our love so caressly

You know I'm jealous of you and yet you seem to try
To go out of your way to be unkind
Sweetheart I'm beggind of you don't break the heart that loves you
Don't break this heart of mine

[ Sax ]
Sweetheart I'm beggind of you don't break the heart that loves you
Don't break this heart of mine
