I never felt as helpless,
As I do today
My world just fell around me
As I watched you drive away
There's nothing left between us,
Somehow we've grown apart
Cause I've got through my head,
I just can't break it to my heart
I can't believe this is me
On the hurting side of pain
Sifting through the ashes
Still trying to find a flame
But the flame has turned to embers
Left Glowing in the dark
I've got it through my head,
I just can't break it to my heart
If I could, Lord knows I would
Spin back the hands of time And
Piece these scattered memories
That are cluttered in my head
Pick up where we left off
And make a Brand new start
I've got it through my Head,
I just can't break it to my heart
Oh I've got it through my head,
I just can't break it to my heart
I just can't, I just can't break it to my heart
I just can't, I just can't break it to my heart
Just Can't break it to my heart
I just can't,
I just can't break it to my heart
